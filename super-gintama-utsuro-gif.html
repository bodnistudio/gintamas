    <h6>In the beginning, as a result of experiencing many deaths, utsuro is shown to be emotionless, even fearless.</h6>
    <br>
    <p>Who is utsuro in farewell, shinsengumi arc? But at the same time, utsuro&#039;s other personalities took over their shared body and decided to kill people, partially as revenge and partially to strive to become human again. He warns utsuro for interf. Utsuro is the personification of his name, for even batoucouldn&#039;t read his mind at all, since it seemed like an empty, unreadable vessel. He taunts and sneers at his opponents with gleeful malice as he cuts down anyone who stood in front of him. He is responsible for shouyou&#039;s arrest and later execution that lead to the emergence of utsuro. Utsuro was part of the tendoshu during this time. In contrast to shouyou, he&#039;s wearing his hair laid back and has red eyes filled with emptiness. She and the latter two fight utsuro just to be soundly defeated. Utsuro (original name unknown) was born with the ability to absorb and contain a high amount of altanawithin his body, granting him near ageless immortality and high regenerative capabilities. He continued being a serial killer until he was caught by the imperial government, who instead of executing him, decided to make him into an assassin, seeing his potential. As nobume reveals a little of utsuro&#039;s history mainly to gintoki and katsura, utsuro visits the harusame elders, the true leaders of the pirates, where they thank each other for destroying each other&#039;s enemies. Utsuro was first introduced arriving in one of the naraku ships on the island where kondou, matsudaira and katsura were imprisoned.</p>
    <p><u>The tsuba of his blade has the form of the manji. His longing for death is shown in every appearance, and even though he is immortal, knowing that kouka, who was immortal as well, died in the end, gave him a little hope. In later chapters he was shown to wear a black kimono with no mask on. When utsuro&#039;s mask got torn off by gintoki, and his appearance like shouyou&#039;s, gintoki suffers a breakdown that, as shown in the next arc, he doesn&#039;t completely r. Just like all naraku assassins, he&#039;s carrying a shakujō with a hidden blade inside. Find this pin and more on gintama by hotbloodedhabanero.</u></p>

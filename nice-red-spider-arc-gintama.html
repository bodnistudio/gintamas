    <p>Tsukuyo: as jiraia&#039;s beloved student, tsukuyo has similarities to his sister. See full list on gintama.fandom.com See full list on gintama.fandom.com In present day, he was still haunted by the fact that he could not protect his sister, who wanted her brother to live freely and therefore committed suicide. Red spider arc is the 28th arc in gintama. He would sacrifice his own body to perform any dirty and dangerous job. This gave birth to jiraia&#039;s twisted sense of devotion, and led him to literally sacrifice his sense of self in devotion to his work. He seemingly resurfaced in order to become the next king of the night by dominating the drug selling business, but it was later found out that he only did it to get tsukuyo&#039;s attention and sway her back on the right path, as he believed she had failed him by relying on sakata gintoki and the yorozuya. See full list on gintama.fandom.com See full list on gintama.fandom.com New villain, and slight revelations about gin’s past. Jiraia taught her everything he knew and was drawn to her. Diviner arc is the 32nd arc in gintama.</p>
    <p><u>Here we go with the 4th major serious arc of gintama. Holding his sister hostage, the enemy, the ones who had also wiped out his family, forced him to obey them and work as their underling. I know that some people consider it among their favorites, so hopefully you get some responses from those people too.

    <h6>• but when he saw that the cake has already been packaged by the shop assistant, he yells dramaticly.</h6>
    <br>
    <p>Katsura encounters ikumatsu as he was on the run from the shinsengumi in episode 39. Katsura and takasugi were already disillusioned with their education, disgusted with their fellow students&#039; pomposity. This was evident that once he decided to go all out on shoukakau, he ignores defense and was capable of making offensive skills, even comparable to a rampaging beast. He is never seen lying around or sitting in a unrefined manner, and he typically keeps his arms in his sleeves when not carrying anything. So in order to be a great general, one must be more careful and more fearful in order to survive and lead the war. See full list on gintama.fandom.com • when you want to pay the strawberry cake, gintoki just went in the shop and want to buy that cake. But he gained a reputation for being clever which allowed him to receive a scholarship to his village&#039;s prestigious military school. In episode 39, he is unluckily spotted and injured by okita sougo and forced to take refuge in a ramen shop. He typically wears a blue kimono with a yellow sash. He was friends with takasugi shinsuke at this time. It is unknown what he was doing after his grandmother died. Katsura leaves with determination to prevent further civilian bloodshed.</p>
    <p><u>In chapter 431, he admitted that he&#039;s in love with ikumatsu&#039;s soba. It was later revealed that both the shogun and the joui rebels knew each other all along. ( ily #look at this duo omg so gorgeous so awesome #my fav duo me thinks …. He also has an extreme imagination and improvisation, as he sometimes does the voices of some inanimate objects and tends to have long and dramatic flashbacks and reflections out of pointless matters. If someone is wondering why i am not doing your requests it’s because my computer broke and i don’t know when i will be able to fix it. Neptune shoukaku in episode 319 describes him as a dainty guy with effeminate and delicate features.</u></p>

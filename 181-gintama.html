              <p><strong>181 Gintama</strong>. Gintama is a story of a handyman named gintoki, a samurai with no respect for rules set by the invaders, who&#039;s ready to take any job to survive. What is the plot of gintama? The story is interesting, but at the same time rarely touched upon by the show.its more a less a couple funny episodes and arcs; Play video games for only an hour a day. However one man, gintoki sakata, still possesses the heart of the samurai, although from his love of sweets and work as a yorozuya, one might not expect it. As a result, a prohibition on swords has been established, and the samurai of japan are treated with disregard as a consequence.</p>

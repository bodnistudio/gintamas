              <p><strong>Amazing Gintama Otae Cooking</strong>. Who is otae&#039;s childhood friend in gintama episode 76? There is no way a small guy like him could ever be a big strong samurai.

He has a request—he wants her to act like kondo&#039;s wife and destroy his arranged marriage. When they arrive they find that kyuubei is also attending the class and would marry ronald mcdonald if she could. And shihouin yoruichi from bleach.</p>

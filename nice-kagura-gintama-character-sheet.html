See full list on fairytail.fandom.com In episode 39, he is unluckily spotted and injured by okita sougo and forced to take refuge in a ramen shop. Here’s the poster for the episode election campaign: Katsura is a genius master swordsman.in his childhood, he was under the tutelage of yoshida shouyoutogether with sakata gintoki and takasugi shinsuke. In the benizakura arc, ikumatsu was one of the people that was shown to be important for him. Since he is a wanted man, katsura usually uses disguises to hide from shinsengumior to wander freely in public. After the powerful shock wave created by their attacks, kagura and the two other female mages begin to assault one another with devastating blows until minerva manages to push erza back with her unnamed magic. In his childhood, katsura&#039;s parents died due to an illness.</p>

    <h6>Kamui later reappears to assist takasugi during their assassination attempt on the shogun.</h6>
    <br>
    <p>He starts to become dominated by the idea of becoming stronger, telling abuto in a later meeting that he does not care what he becomes as long as he. Gintama • kamui and abuto manga icons ♡ (requested) please like if you save them! Please like if you save them! Kamui lived with his parents and his younger sister on rakuyou when he was young. To do so, he planned to kidnap seita just as he and the yorozuyawere being shown a route out of yoshiwara to use as a bargaining chip. Kamui and sougo then start to fight to the death for a short while before being interrupted by an e. Despite majoring excellently in the fighting field, housen describes him as ignorant for being too young and not wise enough to understand the reason for his father and housen&#039;s to settle down and appearing less on battlefields. During another altercation with yato members while walking with baby kagura on his back he is saved by abuto and the harusame. Nov 02, 2019 · gintama • kagura and kamui headers ♡. Kamui also took his place as the 7th captain of the harusame before he became the harusame&#039;s admiral. See full list on gintama.fandom.com See full list on gintama.fandom.com He has a belief that the yato members need to always stay on the battlefield, and this is why he disagrees with housenstaying in yoshiwara as its ruler.he has no interest to romance viewing fights with more importancethe only person that kamui won&#039;t fight is his mother as shown in his past that he has an attachment to his mother and goes so far as to fight his father to take his mother away to her mother planet to prevent her from death.he also believes that having emotional ties to one&#039;s family is a weakness, this being the reason he left his family after failing to kill his father.</p>
    <p><u>It has been shown that women find kamui very attractive considering how much attention he got when he walked on the streets of yoshiwara alone. Although umibouzu suffered severe injuries and lost his left arm during their fight, he managed to defeat his son, causing kamui to leave the family. Kamui decided to delay his fight with takasugi and joined force. He also took up the responsibility to protect his mother and younger sister in the absence of his father umibouzu, who was seldom around as he was travelling around the universe searching for a cure to kouka&#039;s illness. See full list on gintama.fandom.com One of the elites among the yato race, kamui is one of the strongest yato in existence.</u></p>

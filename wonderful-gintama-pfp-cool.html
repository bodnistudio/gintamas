    <p><em>He&#039;s an excellent swordsman, being a perfect equal to gintoki despite the other&#039;s own capabilities and skill. He is first seen on lesson 13&#039;s 18th page, standing beside sakamoto (who, as well, wasn&#039;t introduced yet) with signs of his bandage absent and his eye hidden with hair. When takasugi first officially appears, he first appears before katsura before a festival celebrating the amanto&#039;s first arrival, revealing a similar relationship to him that gintoki has through the unified nickname of zura. The idea to take revenge for his teacher&#039;s death clouds his mind and it&#039;s what drives him to be antagonistic towards gintoki and the bakufu, for it was during the kansei purge that his teacher was killed. He has also been seen playing the shamisen and wearing a sedge hat. Share the best gifs now &gt;&gt;&gt;</em></p>

    <h6>This strong bond between them awakened tsukuyo&#039;s desire to protect hinowa with her life.</h6>
    <br>
    <p>See full list on gintama.fandom.com Tsukuyo is an attractive blonde woman of average height and slender figure. This changed once upon her witnessing hinowa&#039;s a positive influence on the other courtesans, awaking tsukuyo&#039;s desire to protect both hinowa and yoshiwara. Since jirochou was in organized crime and tatsugorou was a deputy officer, the two men would clash many times. However, jirochou only wanted otose to be happy so he backed off and allowed terada. At some point, otose met her future husband, terada tatsugorou. Tsukuyo had known hinowa since she was a child and always thought of her as a big sister. She wears a dark brown/black kimono and has brown hair. See full list on gintama.fandom.com All he needs is the strength to protect one. Let&#039;s just end this with me. Beyond her tough and stoic exterior, however, tsukuyo is kind at heart. As someone who gave up everything that means to be a woman to protect hinowa, tsukuyo is serious at all times, even when making jokes or finding herself in comedic situations.</p>
    <p><u>Tsukuyo was trained by the infamous assassin jiraia, who taught her a fighting style very similar to that of a ninja. Thanks to otose, jirochou became a popular vigilante. Tsukuyo was trained by the infamous assassin jiraia, who taught her a fighting style very similar to that of a ninja. Otose was able to reconcile with jirochou in the end and thanked him for everything and he should keep his other promi. However, jirochou only wanted otose to be happy so he backed off and allowed terada. To do so, she came in contact with the psychopathic and infamous assassin jiraia, who agreed to take her under his wing and teach her everything he knew.</u></p>

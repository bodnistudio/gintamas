              <p><strong>Tremendous Gintama Gintoki Vs Utsuro</strong>. He is responsible for shouyou&#039;s arrest and later execution that lead to the emergence of utsuro. He grows disgusted by their talks of immortality and helps the harusame divisions to overthrow the elders by killing them. Utsuro is the personification of his name, for even batoucouldn&#039;t read his mind at all, since it seemed like an empty, unreadable vessel. Utsuro is rarely shown without a cold, weary smile, which neither shows happiness nor hides sadness. Isaburo continues his plan of rebellion while the alliance retreat from the battlefield. Maybe he eould get better reception on top of all the samurai corpses and ruins of the country.</p>

    <h6>It is unknown what he was doing in the month since although the implication is that he has been quietly getting himself and his naraku ready to make sure the potential war between the vengeful amanto and the earth continues.</h6>

    <p>He taunts and sneers at his opponents with gleeful malice as he cuts down anyone who stood in front of him. Best epic fight ever for me :dthank for watching,hope you enjoy! He taunts and sneers at his opponents with gleeful malice as he cuts down anyone who stood in front of him. See full list on gintama.fandom.com See full list on gintama.fandom.com See full list on gintama.fandom.com Utsuro is the personification of his name, for even batoucouldn&#039;t read his mind at all, since it seemed like an empty, unreadable vessel. He was then placed in prison and forgotten about for decades until he was able to leave when his cell door rotted away. She and the latter two fight utsuro just to be soundly defeated. But at the same time, utsuro&#039;s other personalities took over their shared body and decided to kill people, partially as revenge and partially to strive to become human again. So he formed and lead the naraku for 500 years, conti. See full list on gintama.fandom.com He was fatally wounded by takasugi and gives him (who later tells katsura and gintoki) the information they need about utsuro&#039;s origins and plans before dying.</p>
    <p><u>Just like all naraku assassins, he&#039;s carrying a shakujō with a hidden blade inside. See full list on gintama.fandom.com The tsuba of his blade has the form of the manji. See full list on gintama.fandom.com See full list on gintama.fandom.com In later chapters he was shown to wear a black kimono with no mask on.</u></p>

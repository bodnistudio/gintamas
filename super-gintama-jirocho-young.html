    <h6>However, she is very strict and demands rent from the yorozuya every month.</h6>
    <br>
    <p>All three of them became close friends but both men fell in love with otose. Doromizu jirochou (泥水 次郎長) was the leader of the yakuza syndicate dobunezumi group, and one of the ruling 4 devas of kabuki district before he stepped down from his position in favor of his daughter, with whom he wanted to spend more time. See full list on gintama.fandom.com Otose would always keep him out of trouble and scold him for anything bad that he did. Today’s episode is the fight of gintoki &amp; jirocho vs amanto (shinra) from. See full list on gintama.fandom.com Gin vs jirocho is my favorite fight in gintama although it was pretty short it was one of the few times where gin lost his cool and fought like a mad man, and even in that state jirocho was such a strong opponent that he could fight off gin and eventually defeat him. Otose was able to reconcile with jirochou in the end and thanked him for everything and he should keep his other promi. She wears a dark brown/black kimono and has brown hair. After the war, he became distant from his family and friends. She enlists the help of otae, sachan and tsukuyo to help, but they are each too embarrassed to help her and make her give their chocolates to gintoki. How are katsuo and gintoki related to jirochou? She found gintoki hidden behind her husband&#039;s grave.</p>
    <p><u>Because of her kind and friendly personality, many people were drawn to her thus making her very popular. Otose would always keep him out of trouble and scold him for anything bad that he did. See full list on gintama.fandom.com As jirochou became part of organized crime, everybody became afraid of jirochou but otose continued to believe in him and kept him out of trouble. Otose was able to reconcile with jirochou in the end and thanked him for everything and he should keep his other promi. Her childhood friend and once a love interest.</u></p>

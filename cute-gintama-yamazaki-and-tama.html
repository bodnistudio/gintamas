    <h6>She helps out at otose&#039;s snack barand becomes a poster girl.</h6>

    <p>Tama carries a broom as both a cleaning tool for work and as a weapon. She and sadaharu helped gintoki to regain his identity as a leader of yorozuya. After a chance encounter at a grocery store in episode 268, yamazaki falls in love with tama (almost to the point of obsession). Acknowledging gintoki&#039;s strength, she had created in her body a type of antivirus, and the strongest antivirus was also the leader of them, the leukocyte king (白血球王) and was identical to gintoki.her antivirus was not enough to combat the virus, so the yorozuya had to physically enter tama so they could save her. How did yamazaki fall in love with tama? See full list on gintama.fandom.com Under $10 · returns made easy · money back guarantee In lesson 385, it is revealed that tama is able to cook by taking ingredients into her body and cooking them internally. Touched by tama&#039;s speech, yamazaki falls in love and abandons his assignment to spy on tama. This gives her the apperance of a french maid. This however, allows her to retain some of the daughter&#039;s personality and making her capable of human emotions. Tama&#039;s weapon of choice is a broom that has been customised by gengai with a flame thrower attached. Tama was originally known as no.</p>
    <p><u>It was commissioned by otose as a way to collect rent from gintoki. Yamazaki is shy about sex; See full list on gintama.fandom.com The android version of ryuuzan, no.502, soon began a robot uprising, even hijacking the terminal, in order to retrieve tama and data she carried within her known as the seed. She also seems to have some rather strange main functions, such as imitating the dragon quest rpg. Despite the time, there are various advanced technologies and even spaceships which allow people to travel across space.</u></p>

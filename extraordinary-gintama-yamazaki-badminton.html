    <p><u>Yamazaki carried out the order by first interviewing all those people who hung out with gintoki, including hasegawa, otsuu, et al, but could not turn up anything to tie him. Hijikata explained (while wolfing down a bowl of &#039;hijikata special&#039;) that he ignored gintoki in the past because there was nothing suspicious about his activities that relate to joui activities then. Now as gintoki was injured in the same fracas, a link is established, and yamazaki was ordered to investigate gintoki&#039;s relationship with jouishishi, with the orders that gintoki is to be killed if investigations proved that he is indeed a joui rebel. Despite bansais apparent cruelty he decided not to kill yamazaki as he wished to listen to yamazakis song a little longer. The first kanji of his name (山 yama) means mountain, and the second one (崎zaki) means rough.in the past, he was a punk and called himself mountainzaki. The name yamazaki according to sorachi, yamazaki&#039;s first name, sagaru, means take a step back, view things calmly and deal with them.</u></p>

    <p>Disinfects to kill 99.9% of germs and bacteria, now with more power per drop.* The only thing i could find is gintoki making a reference to bleach in like episode 4 at the very end where he asked a cashier for the latest. Dont forget to read t. Oocness and many many many many flaws. Check out our new, concentrated clorox® disinfecting bleach. I know that gintama uses a fair amount of parody comedy referencing other shows. If you like the video please like and share. The reference occurs during the otsu arc, where shinpachi is in a bitter rivalry with hijikata toushirou over whose fanclub dedicated to otsu, a rising pop star, is the official fan club. Disinfects to kill 99.9% of germs and bacteria, now with more power per drop.* To top off all the cameos, a lookalike of ichigo himself—in shinigami form and hollow mask—appears near the end. Popular japanese actor, plays gintoki in the gintama live action movies one piece episode 141, timeskip arc, episode 364: The author is a huge bleach fan. Both series are long running(gintama is ongoing with its new season)but bleach has one arc not adapted into anime.</p>
    <p><u>Gintama is a comedy based anime with humour less action series. Oocness and many many many many flaws. Disinfects to kill 99.9% of germs and bacteria, now with more power per drop.* The only thing i could find is gintoki making a reference to bleach in like episode 4 at the very end where he asked a cashier for the latest. Toyako, the spirit of gintoki&#039;s sword, looks a lot like a less cool zangetsu. Dont forget to read t.</u></p>
